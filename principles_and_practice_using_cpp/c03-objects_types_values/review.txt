1. What is meant by the term prompt?

	To 'prompt' the user for input

2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable?

	The '>>' operator.

3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value int your program?

	cout << "Give me a number:" << endl;
	cin >> number;

4. What is '\n' called and what purpose does it serve?

	The 'new-line' character. It delimits lines of a file

5. What terminates input into a string?

	The 'end-of-file' character. Linux/unix this is Ctrl+D

6. What terminates input into an integer?

	Non-numeric input

7. too easy

8. What is an object?

	Some memory that holds a value of a given type

9. What is a literal?

	A particular fundamental value

10. What kinds of literals are there?

	String literals, int literals, double literals

11. What is a variable?

	A named object

12. What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?

	char = 1 byte
	int = 4 bytes
	double = 8 bytes

13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?

	bytes and bits

14. What is the difference between = and ==?

	= is the assignment operator.
	== is the binary equality operator

15. What is a definition?

	A declaration that sets aside memory for an object

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?

	An initialization is the birth of a named variable's value. It always happens to a named variable that does not have a value in its memory location yet. An assignment is an initialization that must clear the memory address of its contents before putting the new value there.

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?

	string s = "abc" + "def"; // s == "abcdef"

18. Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, why not?

	This_little_pig		This_1_is_fine		2_For_1_special
	latest thing		the_$12_method		_this_is_ok
	MiniMineMine		number				correct?

	the_$12_method and correct? are not ok - invalid characters ($, ?)
	2_For_1_special is incorrect because it does not start with a letter
	_this_is_ok is OK but runs the risk of clashing with a language implementation name since they use leading underscores

19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they ar likely to cause confusion

	String, string, f0o, foO, f00

20. What are some good rules for choosing names?

	Not too long, not too short, descriptive

21. What is type safety and why is it important?

	The notion of always performing sanctioned operations on types/objects. It is important so as to prevent undefined behavior.

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?

	You can inadvertantly lose information (2.3 -> 2)

23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.

	If sizeof(a) > sizeof(b), chances are the conversion is unsafe
