3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.

	main()

4. In the "Hello, World!" program, what is the purpose of the line return 0; ?

	The return code of the program passed to the system that invoked it. A return value of 0 indicates everything was succesful.

5. What is the purpose of the compiler?

8. What does the linker do for your program?

	The linker links together multiple object files, or the resulting files from having compiled multiple translation units, and links them together into an executable that can be run.

9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?

	A source file contains the raw C++ source code whereas an object file contains the machine code as a result of compiling the C++ source code.

10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?

	An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) offers things like syntax highlighting/code completion/automated compiler invocation/etc.

11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?

	Because good programming habbits only come with practice and understood things only become second nature through practice and repetition.
